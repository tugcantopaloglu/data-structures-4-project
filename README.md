# Project Details
Made while taking data structres class. Made with Turkish language for class.  

**Project Problems:** Arrays, Matrices, Methods, Random Numbers   

**Explanations:**    
First mission was generating distance matrix from points in a 2D plane. A distance matrix is a table that shows the distance between pairs of objects. You can take a look this examples to understand that.  
  
Take column and the line as a point referance.

So distance matrix formula is this.

Second one was money classification using K-Nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. In the end program checking every money if it is real or not with given banknote data. Banknote data has variance, skewness, kurtosis and entropy. Using this values as a authentication value with KNN and proccess them with given test banknotes. Take a look for example money data.
